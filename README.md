# OPSG
A verilog implementation of variants of the SN76489 programmable sound generator. It aims to provide a parameterized module which can closely replicate the behaviour of all the variants by providing
options for things like: tapped bits, shift register size, etc...

# Simulation
Run the test benches with iverilog using the following commands:
```
iverilog [testbench.v] [design.v] -o wave.out
```
Then, use vvp to convert the 'test.out' file into a format .bcd which gtkwave can view:
```
vvp wave.out
```
Finally, open the waveform using gtkwave:
```
gtkwave dump.bcd
```
